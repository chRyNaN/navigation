            Button(onClick = { navigator.goTo("Farewell") }) {
                Text("Say Goodbye")
            }

## Usage üë®‚Äçüíª

#### Destinations

`NavigationDestinations` represent the locations within an application that a `Navigator` can coordinate. They can be of
any type and can contain any data that is useful to render the destination UI. A common approach is to use enums or
sealed classes to represent the different `NavigationDestinations` within an application.

```kotlin
enum class AppDestination {

    HOME,
    SEARCH,
    SETTINGS,
    DETAILS
}
```

#### Contexts

A `NavigationContext` is a way of representing complex or nested navigation destinations. A `NavigationContext` defines
its `initialDestination` and has its own stack of `NavigationDestinations` associated with it within the internal
implementation of a `Navigator`. This allows there to be a stack of stacks of `NavigationDestinations` for an
application.

```kotlin
enum class MainContext(
    override val initialDestination: AppDestination,
    val title: String,
    val icon: ImageVector
) : NavigationContext<AppDestination> {

    HOME(title = "Home", icon = Icons.Default.Home, initialDestination = AppDestination.Home),

    SEARCH(title = "Search", icon = Icons.Default.Search, initialDestination = AppDestination.Search),

    SETTINGS(title = "Settings", icon = Icons.Default.Settings, initialDestination = AppDestination.Settings)
}
```

#### Navigator

A `Navigator` is used to navigate between navigation contexts and destinations via the
convenient `goTo`, `changeContext`, and `goBack` functions. A `Navigator` can be obtained via one of the constructor
functions or the `remember`/`rememberSavable` functions when using Jetpack Compose/Multiplatform Compose.

```kotlin
val navigator = rememberNavigator(initialDestination = AppDestination.HOME)

BackHandler { navigator.goBack() }

ListItem(modifier = Modifier.clickable { navigator.goTo(AppDestination.DETAILS) })
```

#### NavigationContainer

The `NavigationContainer` composable provides a convenient way to listening to destination and context state changes and
recomposing its content accordingly. Just provide a `Navigator` instance and a content composable.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun App() {
    val navigator = rememberNavigator(initialDestination = AppDestination.HOME)

    NavigationContainer(navigator = navigator) { destination ->
        when (destination) {
            AppDestination.HOME -> HomeScreenComposable()
            AppDestination.SEARCH -> SearchScreenComposable()
            AppDestination.SETTINGS -> SettingsScreenComposable()
            AppDestination.DETAILS -> DetailsScreenComposable()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Transitions and animations

You have complete control over the composable functions that render the UI of the application and can use the Jetpack
Compose library's transition and animation APIs to change between the navigation context and destination UIs. For more
fine-grained control, create a custom composable replacing the `NavigationContainer` that handles transitions properly
for your application. Then just listen and react to the `Navigator.state` changes.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun <Destination : NavigationDestination, Context : NavigationContext<Destination>> MyNavContainer(
    navigator: Navigator<Destination, Context>,
) {
    val context = navigator.store.context.collectAsState()
    val destination = navigator.store.destination.collectAsState()

    // Render UI from context and destination values and apply any transition or animation desired.
}
```
