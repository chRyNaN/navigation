# goUp

[common]\
open fun [goUp](go-up.md)(): [Boolean](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html)

Performs an &quot;up&quot; navigation. An &quot;up&quot; navigation is similar to a &quot;back&quot; navigation but may be slightly different. For instance, on Android, the &quot;left arrow&quot; button in the toolbar component of an application, performs the &quot;up&quot; operation, which is slightly different from the phones back button which performs a &quot;back&quot; operation.

Currently, this defaults to the same operation as the [goBack](go-back.md) function.
